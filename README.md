👩‍💻 With over 5 years of experience as a Frontend & Full Stack Developer, I specialize in crafting robust web applications and websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frontend frameworks like React and Redux. I have a strong foundation in developing intuitive user interfaces and optimizing code for performance.

🔍 Additionally, during my masters, I delved into human-computer interaction, animation, and graphics, further enriching my understanding of user experience design and visual storytelling.

🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by exploring Vue.js and python, aiming to deepen my proficiency in both frontend and backend development.

👯 I'm passionate about collaborating on open source projects, leveraging collective knowledge and driving innovation within the developer community.

✔ Don't hesitate to reach out to me for any inquiries or assistance—I'm always eager to help!

📖 Beyond the screen, I find joy in playing tennis, expressing myself through music as both a singer and a listener, and immersing myself in the wonders of nature outdoors. Let's connect and share our passions! 🌴🎵🎾
